This is a vanilla Wizard for Visual C++ 4.x
It just creates the files in the specified directory.

Note that I do no know how to change the compilation
options from the Wizard code. MicroSoft seems to be able 
to do that however (undocumented calls?).

Despite this limitation, the Wizard works because the
default options are working well enough. We still
need some pieces of magic in "user_dll.c" that would
be better located in the "Makefile".
