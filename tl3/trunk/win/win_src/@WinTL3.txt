Windows version of TLisp
------------------------


This program is the windows interface to TLisp.
It is linked with the TLisp DLL

During initialization this program:
- creates the main window and the console window
- creates a pipe receiving all characters sent to the standard output
- creates a task that runs function TL3MAIN in the TLisp DLL

During normal work this program

- reacts to user interaction 
	- editing text files,
	- moving windows,
	- pressing buttons

- reacts to RPC messages sent by the TLisp task
	- get a line from console
	- create graphic windows
	- exit tlisp

- display standard output (read from the pipe) to the console


Everything printed to the standard output gets replicated
in the console window (because we use a pipe). Programs
spawned by TLisp thus could print things into the console
(if windows was handling this feature properly!)

Standard input works differently. TLisp performs a remote 
procedure call (TL3_GETLINE) whenever it needs a line of
input. WinTL3 then extracts a line from the console input
buffer and writes it into the stdin pipe.

Ask a consequence, programs spawned by WinTL3 cannot access
the standard input. They continuously receive EOF characters.
I do not want to program a terminal emulator!
