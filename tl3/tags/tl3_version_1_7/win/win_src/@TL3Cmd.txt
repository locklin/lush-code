
Console version of TLisp
------------------------

This project just defines a stub 
- linked with the TLisp Dynamic Link Library (DLL)
- that just calls function TL3MAIN 

The console version of TLisp therefore cannot produce graphics.
We may allow this in the future by enhancing TL3Cmd like WinTL3.
