<b>2003-01-29</b>: many changes in the CVS version: pre-tokenized
environment makes startup very fast; much improved scripting capability
(the standard environment is now loaded by default); added self-executable
demos; added initial versions of opencv, torch, and inventor interfaces;
updated handling of destructors in compiled code; release 0.97 is coming soon.
<p>
<b>2003-01-07</b>: <font color="#ff0000">Lush 0.96 is released!</font>.
A huge amount of stuff has been added since version 0.95:
comdraw/ivtools graphic driver; gblearn2 machine learning library
(including a convolutional neural net training demo);
prompt line edition, history, and symbol completion; BSD support;
updated video grabbing library; and numerous bug fixes and 
documentation updates
<p>
<b>2002-11-07</b>: The comdraw/ivtools graphic driver is in the CVS!
This wonderful thing, written be Secil Ugurel,
allows to pipe Lush graphic commands to comdraw. Comdraw is
a graphic/drawing editor distributed as part of the ivtools
package (available at http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/index.html).
With this, Lush-generated graphics are instantaneously editable!
<p>

<b>2002-11-04</b>: Leon added readline support to the CVS version. This 
 provides Lush with prompt-line editing, history, symbol and filename
 completion, etc, without having to run Lush within Emacs.
<p>
<b>2002-11-03</b>: <font color="#ff0000">Lush 0.95 is released!</font>. 
 Get it and report any problem you find to the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=410163&group_id=34223&func=browse">
bug tracker</a> so we can 
 converge quickly to a 1.0 release.
<p>

<b>2002-10-24</b>: ALSA, audiofile, and OpenCV are in the CVS.
  We need a couple juicy demos and sample code for those.
<p>

<b>2002-10-17</b>: We are very close to a first release (v0.9).
  This first version may come without some of the packages
  (e.g. Torch). These packages are essentially
  ready (thanks Jie!), but they need a couple more weeks of work.
  When they are ready, we will release version 1.0.
<p>
<b>2002-10-16</b>: no release yet, but everything is in place for
  it. Get a CVS snapshot if you are in a hurry.
<p>
<b>2002-10-16</b>: the Lush web site is up!
<p>
<b>2002-10-11</b>: Jie has been working on an interface to the
  Python API and to the JavaVM API. With these, you will be
  able to call Python and Java from Lush.
<p>
<b>2002-10-10</b>: We have almost completed a graphic driver that will
  send Lush graphic commands to comdraw (part of the 
  <a href="http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools">IVtools</a> package). 
  This will let Lush users generate editable graphics.
  Being able to edit graphics produced by Lush is 
  a very useful feature when preparing publications
  or reports.
<p>
<b>2002-10-09</b>: We are working on a new set of plotting
  functions. The ones currently included in the CVS are
  very old, and very outdated. Suggestions for features
  are welcome.
<p>
<b>2002-10-08</b>: We committed a brand new documentation
  system and browsing tool. Like the old system, this new 
  system allows to include documentation in the source files
  or in separate documentation files. Unlike the old system
  it uses a syntax that looks like a mixture of HTML and 
  pseudo-lisp. on-screen help, HTML, and LateX can be generated
  from this format.
