<b>2003-02-19</b>: Rejoice, rejoice! Thanks to Leon, the CVS version
now compiles and runs on Windoze under <a
href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>.  Be sure to read the
README.cygwin before installing. What works: the interpreter, the
compiler, the dynamic loader, X11 graphics and events. What doesn't
(yet) work: external packages such as GSL, SDL, OpenGL....
