<b>2004-01-24</b>: Problem on Mandrake 9.2:
it seems that the version of GCC distributed with Mandrake Linux 9.2 
has a bug that prevents Lush from running properly. The fix?
edit lush/src/Makefile and change the "-O3" by a "-O2"
in the line that begins with "OPTS=".
Another possibility is to simply install the Lush RPM that
comes with Mandrake 9.2!
<p>
<b>2003-11-15</b>: Version 0.99 is out. Lots of bug fixes,
new libraries, improved documentation, Cygwin compatibility,
support for communication and control of remote Lush processes,
package for quadratic programming (svpq.lsh), joystick support,
optional support for MPI (message passing interface for parallel
programming), and a simple GUI tool for neural net building and training
(sn28).
A new "contrib" directory was added. It contains Simon Anders's 
sparse matrix classes.
<p>
<b>2003-02-19</b>: Rejoice, rejoice! Thanks to Leon, the CVS version
now compiles and runs on Windoze under <a
href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>.  Be sure to read the
README.cygwin before installing. What works: the interpreter, the
compiler, the dynamic loader, X11 graphics and events. What doesn't
(yet) work: external packages such as GSL, SDL, OpenGL....
<p>
<b>2003-02-04</b>: <font color="#ff0000">Lush 0.97 is released!</font>
This version has: a pre-tokenized environment which makes the startup
sequence very quick; much improved scripting capabilities; a demos
directory with executable demo scripts; initial versions of opencv
(computer vision package), torch (machine learning library), inventor
(3D scene graph rendering), and libdc (firewire frame grabbing).
