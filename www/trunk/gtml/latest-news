<b>2005-01-18</b>: A version of Lush compiled for the Sharp Zaurus is 
<a href="http://www.mneuroth.de/privat/zaurus/lush.html">available
here</a> (no X-window and no dynamic loader support).
Our thanks go to <A href="http://www.mneuroth.de/">Michael Neuroth.</a>
<p>
<b>2004-09-18</b>: A new library Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
 kernel-based methods was added to the CVS version (see lush/packages/svm).
<p>
<b>2004-08-05</b>: version 1.0 is out!
<p>
<b>2004-06-13</b>: added support for serial and parallel port in CVS version.
<p>
<b>2004-01-24</b>: Problem on Mandrake 9.2/10.0:
it seems that the version of GCC distributed with Mandrake Linux
(and other distros) has a bug that prevents Lush from running
properly. The fix? edit lush/src/Makefile and change the "-O3" by a "-O2"
in the line that begins with "OPTS=".
