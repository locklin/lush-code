This directory contains the subset of the SN3.2 Lisp 
interpreter/compiler and libraries that is not owned by Neuristique S.A.
(i.e. the pieces of SN3.2 owned by either AT&T, Leon Bottou, or Yann LeCun).
This code is not functional as is, but is intended as a repository of 
code to be ported to Lush.
