See file README for the history of SN, TL and LUSH.

Brief overview:

AT&T Labs SN3.2 contains
(a)- code owned by Neuristique s.a. and licensed by AT&T.
(b)- code owned by AT&T.

TL3 contains
(c)- code owned by Neuristique s.a. 
     (somehow different from the above)
     and licensed under the GPL by Neuristique s.a.

This CVS subtree contains the initial LUSH release.
This code is built using (b) and (c) only.
Code (b) has been released by AT&T under the GPL.
Code (c) has been released by Neuristique under the GPL.
Files in this CVS subtree therefore are
all available under the terms of the GPL.

But it does not work very well yet.

- Leon Bottou and Yann Le Cun.


APRIL 16TH, 2002 --- This subtree is now FROZEN. 
Neither Yann or Leon work for AT&T Labs anymore.
We keep the subtree frozen in order to document 
the initial release.
