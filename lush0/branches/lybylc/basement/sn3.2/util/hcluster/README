This directory contains code to compute k-means and hierarchical k-means.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Method 1) You can use it by loading hcluster/hcluster.sn from anywhere
(but I recomend starting from the example, in method 2).  The bulk
of the code is in the following 3 files:

        cluster.h
        cluster.c
        hcluster.sn

Once you have loaded hcluster.sn, the following help is available:

        ^Aclustering.		general information on how to write
                                your applications, and interface
        ^Acluster-tree.         A wrapper which takes care of 
                                memory allocation and stuff for
                                hierachical clustering.
        ^An-clusters.           A wrapper which takes care of 
                                memory allocation and stuff for
                                k-means clustering.

From there, you have to write your C structure and functions and
interface them correctly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Method 2) Another (friendlier) way to get started is to load 
hcluster/euc-cluster.sn.  This loads the C structures and functions
to do k-means (and hierarchical k-means) when the distance used is the
Euclidean over a N-dimensional space.  Once you have loaded this file,
you get additional help on:

        ^Aeuc-cluster-tree.     same as cluster-tree with Euc. Dist. and
                                a much simpler interface.
        ^Aeuc-cluster.          same as n-cluster with Euc. Dist. and
                                a much simpler interface.

To get inspired on how to write your own C structures and functions 
(to implement your own distances), look at the files:

        euc_func.h
        euc_func.c
        euc-cluster.sn
        
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An example of clustering and hierarchical clustering is in euc-test.sn.
Load hcluster/euc-test.sn and try (test-tree (init-gauss 1000 5) 4) to see
how hierchical clustering (stopped at 4 clusters) works on a distribution 
consisting of 5 guassians.
