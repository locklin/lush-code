# lush-code
This is a git svn backup of svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/lush/code/

For most people, you'll want to 

cd lush1
./configure
make


I didn't try to get the author's git profile info correct, if they even use git: sorry.

Untested code, but unlike my attempts to revive lush2.0.1 this one compiles at least. I suspect some of the dll linking stuff might not work properly. No idea if osx will work.
