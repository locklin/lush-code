# lush-code
This is a git svn backup of svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/lush/code/

For most people, you'll want to 

cd lush1;
./configure;
make


I didn't try to get the author's git profile info correct, if they even use git: sorry.

Untested code, but unlike my attempts to revive lush2.0.1 this one compiles at least. I suspect some of the dll linking stuff might not work properly. No idea if osx will work.


If it's not clear, I didn't write this. It's the programming environment written by Leon Bottou and Yann LeCun when they developed convolutional nets aka the great granddaddy of all of deep learning.
I found it very interesting back in the 00s and used it quite a bit up to around 2009. The language underwent some breaking changes with 64 bit Lush2 and R coding paid better.
I still love it and was happy Leon checked in some code a few months ago to get lush1 compilable. Not sure what he's planning on doing with it, but here it is for me and frens to marvel at.
