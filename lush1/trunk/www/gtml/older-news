<b>2002-10-11</b>: Jie has been working on an interface to the
  Python API and to the JavaVM API. With these, you will be
  able to call Python and Java from Lush.

<b>2002-10-10</b>: We have almost completed a graphic driver that will
  send Lush graphic commands to comdraw (part of the 
  <a href="http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools">IVtools</a> package). 
  This will let Lush users generate editable graphics.
  Being able to edit graphics produced by Lush is 
  a very useful feature when preparing publications
  or reports.

<b>2002-10-09</b>: We are working on a new set of plotting
  functions. The ones currently included in the CVS are
  very old, and very outdated. Suggestions for features
  are welcome.
<p>
<b>2002-10-08</b>: We committed a brand new documentation
  system and browsing tool. Like the old system, this new 
  system allows to include documentation in the source files
  or in separate documentation files. Unlike the old system
  it uses a syntax that looks like a mixture of HTML and 
  pseudo-lisp. on-screen help, HTML, and LateX can be generated
  from this format.
