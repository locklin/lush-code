<b>2002-11-04</b>: Leon added readline support to the CVS version. This 
 provides Lush with prompt-line editing, history, etc, without 
 running Lush within Emacs.

<b>2002-11-03</b>: <font color="#ff0000">Lush 0.95 is released!</font>. 
 Get it and report any problem you find to the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=410163&group_id=34223&func=browse">
bug tracker</a> so we can 
 converge quickly to a 1.0 release.

<b>2002-10-24</b>: ALSA, audiofile, and OpenCV are in the CVS.
  We need a couple juicy demos and sample code for those.
