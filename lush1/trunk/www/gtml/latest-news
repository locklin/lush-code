<b>2002-11-07</b>: The comdraw/ivtools graphic driver is in the CVS!
This wonderful thing, written be Secil Ugurel and Leon Bottou,
allows to pipe Lush graphic commands to comdraw. Comdraw is
a graphic/drawing editor distributed as part of the ivtools
package (available at http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/index.html).
With this, Lush-generated graphics are instantaneously editable!
<p>

<b>2002-11-04</b>: Leon added readline support to the CVS version. This 
 provides Lush with prompt-line editing, history, symbol and filename
 completion, etc, without having to run Lush within Emacs.
<p>
<b>2002-11-03</b>: <font color="#ff0000">Lush 0.95 is released!</font>. 
 Get it and report any problem you find to the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=410163&group_id=34223&func=browse">
bug tracker</a> so we can 
 converge quickly to a 1.0 release.
<p>

<b>2002-10-24</b>: ALSA, audiofile, and OpenCV are in the CVS.
  We need a couple juicy demos and sample code for those.
