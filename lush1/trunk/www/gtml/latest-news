<b>2002-10-17</b>: We are very close to a first release (v0.9).
  This first version will come without the interfaces to
  ALSA, OpenRM, Torch, and HTK. These packages are essentially
  ready (thanks Jie!), but they need a couple more weeks of work.
  When they are ready, we will release version 1.0.

<b>2002-10-16</b>: no release yet, but everything is in place for
  it. Get a CVS snapshot if you are in a hurry.
