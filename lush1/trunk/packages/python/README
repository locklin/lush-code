1. only works with python2.2.1 (or higher)
2. needs both python and libpython2.2-devel (for the header files)
3. load python.lsh under Lush to compile the interface
4. to try the test scripts under ./demo, you need to setup the environment variable PYTHONPATH correctly, so that python knows where to load the modules. for example, PYTHONPATH=~/lush/packages/python/demo
