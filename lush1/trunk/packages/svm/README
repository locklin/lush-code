kernel.lsh --
  A generic class for representing kernels.
  Shared by all the SVM implementations below.

libsvm.lsh -- 
  Interface with the well known libsvm library.
  The libsvm source code is in directory libsvm.
              
svqp.lsh --
  Interface with the rather old svqp QP solver.
  This can be useful for computing optima with
  high accuracy.
