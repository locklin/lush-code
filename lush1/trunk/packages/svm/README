kernel.lsh --
  A generic class for representing kernels.
  Shared by all the SVM implementations below.

libsvm.lsh -- 
  Interface with the well known LIBSVM library.
  The libsvm source code is in directory libsvm.
              
svqp.lsh --
  Interface with the rather old SVQP solver.
  This can be useful for computing optima with
  high accuracy.

svqpsvm.lsh --
  A CSVM implemented with the SVQP2 solver.
  This is slighly faster than LIBSVM.

mysvm.lsh --
  Native CSVM solver for lush.
  Work in progress....

kernelcache.lsh --
  A kernel caching code based on MYSVM facilities.

sparsevector.lsh --
  Sparse vector routines based on MYSVM facilities.
