kernel.lsh --
  A generic class for representing kernels.
  Shared by all the SVM implementations below.

libsvm.lsh -- 
  Interface with the well known LIBSVM library.
  The libsvm source code is in directory libsvm.
              
svqp.lsh --
  Interface with the rather old SVQP solver.
  This can be useful for computing optima with
  high accuracy.

svqpsvm.lsh --
  A CSVM implemented with the SVQP2 solver.
  This is slighly faster than LIBSVM.

lasvm.lsh, lasvmcache.lsh, lasvmload.lsh --
  Work in progress....

lasvmvector.lsh --
  Sparse vector routines based on LASVM facilities.
