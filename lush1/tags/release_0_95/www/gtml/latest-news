<b>2002-10-24</b>: ALSA, audiofile, and OpenCV are in the CVS.
  We need a couple juicy demos and sample code for those.
<p>
<b>2002-10-17</b>: We are very close to a first release (v0.9).
  This first version may come without some of the packages
  (e.g. Torch). These packages are essentially
  ready (thanks Jie!), but they need a couple more weeks of work.
  When they are ready, we will release version 1.0.
<p>
<b>2002-10-16</b>: no release yet, but everything is in place for
  it. Get a CVS snapshot if you are in a hurry.
<p>
<b>2002-10-16</b>: the Lush web site is up!
