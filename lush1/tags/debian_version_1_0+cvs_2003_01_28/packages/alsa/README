to compile the lush script for Alsa, you need the Alsa header files. A
distro like Mandrake 9.0 may come with Alsa pre-installed, but usually
it lacks the header files unless you install the alsa-devel package
that comes with your distro.

If your distro doesn't have Alsa, download alsa-lib-$VERSION.tar.bz2, 
from http://www.alsa-project.org
