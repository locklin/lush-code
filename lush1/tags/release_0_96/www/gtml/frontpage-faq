[[faqentry(What's with all the frogs?)]]

Well, [[YANN]] and [[LEON]] are both French, and many of the past 
contributors have been French or French-speaking (Patrice Simard, 
Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, Pascal Vincent).
<p>
Years of extensive focus groups studies and consultation with top 
marketing experts convinced us that using an <b>escargot</b> would 
send the wrong message for an allegedly fast language.
<p>
Also, frogs are very good at catching bugs. 
<p>
Cute penguins and gnus were already taken, as well as the
numerous species found on the covers of O'Reilly books.

We like frogs. Really. Some of our best friends are frogs.
Particularly those accompanied by garlic and butter.<br>

[[faqentry("I want to get started, is there a good tutorial on Lush?")]]

Have a look <a href="lush-manual/30381be4.html">at this tutorial</a>.

[[faqentry(This site looks like a rip-off of the <a href="http://djvu.sourceforge.net">DjVuLibre</a> site)]]

Lush and <a href="http://djvu.sourceforge.net">DjVu</a> were produced by 
the same people (in fact Lush was used to prototype the first version
of DjVu). So, no rip-off, just laziness.
